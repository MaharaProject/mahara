Ubuntu (10.04/"Lucid Lynx" or later), however it will probably run in any
OS with a suitable web server.

### Web Server

Mahara is only officially supported on Apache 2 or later, although it will
probably run in any web server with the proper PHP extensions.

modification to support other databases.
