Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve
Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the
complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1,
Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was designed
with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly
appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces,
and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.


Roboto Slab

Changes: Using Latin Extended

Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms
are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly
and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to
force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to
be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural
reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.
