<h3>Upload file</h3>
<p>You may attach any number of files to a journal entry. Files added to a journal entry are automatically stored within your file repository area and contribute to your file storage quota.</p>
<p>If you upload a file then cancel the entry or close the journals area without saving, those files will also be removed from your file repository.</p>
<p>If you attach an image to a journal entry, you can use the image button within the HTML editor to embed it into your entry. You will be able to change the size, alignment, border and space around the image using the fields provided.</p>
<p>You can also embed an image as a link from another web site. You can either enter the URL of the image or &#8216;drag and drop&#8217; the image from the web site into the HTML editor. Please ensure you have the appropriate copyright permission to use this image.</p>
<p>For best results, images should be no more than 400x400 pixels and have less than 5 pixels of padding on each side.</p>
