<h3>Upload File</h3>
<p>You may attach any number of files to a Journal entry. Files added to a Journal entry are automatically stored within your file repository area in a folder called &#8216;blogfiles&#8217; and contribute to your file storage quota.</p>
<p>If you upload a file then Cancel the entry or close the Journals area without saving, those files will also be removed from your file repository.</p>
