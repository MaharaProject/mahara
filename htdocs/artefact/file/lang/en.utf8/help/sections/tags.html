<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>You can add tags to artefacts and pages you create. Tags allow you to add descriptive labels to artefacts and pages and create an index of them.</p>
<p>To associate multiple tags to an artefact or page, separate each tag entry with a comma. For example – ‘Assessment, Semester 2, Management’.</p>
<p>Clicking on <b>Show my tags</b> will generate a list of those tags you have previously used within your portfolio and the number of times they have been entered. Clicking on an existing tag will add it to the tag list for the artefact or page you are currently creating or editing.</p>
