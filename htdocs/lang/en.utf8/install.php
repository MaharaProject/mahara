$string['aboutdefaultcontent'] = '<h2>About Mahara</h2>

<p>Established in 2006, Mahara is the result of a collaborative venture funded by New Zealand\'s Tertiary Education Commission\'s e-learning Collaborative Development Fund (eCDF), involving Massey University, Auckland University of Technology, The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand and Victoria University of Wellington.</p>

<p>Mahara is a fully featured electronic portfolio, weblog, resume builder and social networking system, connecting users and creating online communities. Mahara is designed to provide users with the tools to create a personal and professional learning and development environment.</p>

<p>Meaning `think\' or `thought\' in Te Reo Maori, the name reflects the project collaborator\'s dedication to creating a user-centred life long learning and development application as well as the belief that technology solutions cannot be developed outside the considerations of pedagogy and policy.</p>
