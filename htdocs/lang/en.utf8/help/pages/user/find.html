<h3>Find people</h3>
<p>This page lets you search for users to add as friends or simply to find
   their profile page. Depending on their friendship control settings, you may
   be automatically accepted as their friend or you may need to send a
   friendship request. Some users may not allow friendship requests at all.</p>
<p>When sending a friendship request, you can choose to include a short message
  introducing yourself. This is especially important if you have a display name
  set as others will not see your real name.</p>
