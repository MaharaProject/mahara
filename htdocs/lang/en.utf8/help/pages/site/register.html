<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>If your ePortfolio account is not created by your institution, you will need to register yourself. In this case, complete and submit this registration form. An email will be sent to your address. This will contain a clickable link – follow this to confirm your account and log in to the system. If you do not receive this email within 24 hours, please check your email junk filter. If you have any problems registering, please contact the site administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The email link is only valid for 24 hours. After this you must repeat the process.</p>
<p>You will then be prompted to complete any mandatory profile fields, and have an opportunity to upload a profile picture. Once registered, you will need to enter your username and password (and possibly your institution) in order to log in to your portfolio.</p>
