<h3>Behat steps</h3>
<p>You can have a quick overview of the available Behat steps and where they are used in the tests. All tests are located in the /test/behat/features directory in the codebase.</p>
<p>Variables that are found in feature lines are represented by "?" to group these lines more easily. The actual lines do show the correct variables.</p>
