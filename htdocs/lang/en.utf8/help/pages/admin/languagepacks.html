<h1>Languages</h1>
<p>This page lists the languages that are installed and when they were last
  updated through this interface. If you update a language via CLI or add a language pack directly to
  your server, the updated date will not be correct.</p>
<p>You can choose to install new languages by selecting them from the drop-down
  menu. The translation available for your version of Mahara is automatically selected.</p>
<p>As translations are maintained by the community, not all languages will be
  fully translated. You are welcome to <a href="https://wiki.mahara.org/wiki/Developer_Area/Language_Packs">join the translation team</a> to correct
  phrases and translate those for which there is no translation yet.</p>
<p>When updates have been made to a translation in Launchpad, it usually takes
  up to 24 hours for the changes to be present in a language's 'language pack'.
  Refer to our
  <a href="https://langpacks.mahara.org/">language pack site</a>.</p>
<p>If a translation cannot be installed, you will see an error message. Please
  remove the language manually from your server in the location mentioned in
  the error message.</p>
<p>If the installation of a language fails without an error message, this may
  be due to cached information. Please clear the cache at 'Administration menu
  → Admin home → Overview' and try again.</p>
<p>If you want to delete a language, please do so directly on the server. You
  cannot remove a language from this interface.</p>
