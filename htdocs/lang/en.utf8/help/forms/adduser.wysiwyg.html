<h3>HTML Editor</h3>
<p>An HTML editor is available for use on some sections of the site. This is known as a ‘What you see is what you get’ (WYSIWYG) editor. This allows you to apply formatting to your text eg: bolded or italic text. If the editor is turned off you can only enter plain text.</p>
<p>This setting might be disabled by site admin.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>HTML editors may appear and work slightly differently in some browsers.</p>
