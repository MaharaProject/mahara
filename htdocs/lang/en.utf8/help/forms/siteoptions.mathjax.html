<h3>MathJax</h3>
MathJax is a JavaScript display engine for TeX, LaTeX, AsciiMath and MathMl notation which allows mathematics and science equations to be displayed in Mahara pages.
<p>MathJax allows the display of equations throughout your Mahara installation.</p>
<h4>MathJax URL</h4>
<p>The default configuration uses the latest stable version on the MathJax Content Distribution Network (CDN). http and https protocols may be used as appopriate.</p>
<p>Alternatively, $cfg->mathjaxpath may use a local server installation of MathJax. See <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/installation.html">the documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The default includes a commonly used configuration allowing input of MathML, AsciiMath, TeX or LaTeX and processing to MathML or HTML-CSS.</p>
<h4>Additional configuration of MathJax</h4>
<p>Additional MathJax configuration can be added to $cfg->mathjaxconfig. The default MathJax configuration should be appropriate for most users, but MathJax is highly configurable and any of the standard MathJax configuration options can be added here.</p>
<p>By default, the mhchem extension which adds the \ce macro for chemical formulae is included. See <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html#tex-and-latex-extensions">the documentation</a> for more information.</p>
