<h4>Course Groups</h4>
<p>Course groups are a special type of group which can only be created by Administrators and Staff of the site.</p>
<p>Course groups can contain tutors as well as ordinary members.  All members of course groups can submit their pages to the group for assessment by tutors.  When tutors give feedback on a submitted page, they can also attach a file to the feedback which is only visible to the page's author.</p>
<p>There are two types of Course groups:</p>

<h6>Course: Request Membership</h6>
<p>Users may join the group by requesting membership, described under the Request Membership heading above.</p>

<h6>Course: Controlled Membership</h6>
<p>Controlled Membership Course groups allow group administrators to add and remove people from the group directly. Tutors can only add people to the group directly.</p>
<p>This is designed to be used for a course-based group where the membership is defined by an external system (such as an institution's enrolment system) and you wish to replicate that membership in the group.</p>
<p>Users cannot remove themselves from a controlled group.</p>
