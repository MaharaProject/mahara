<h1>Allow peers to see portfolio content</h1>
<p>The 'Peer' role is only available for portfolio access.</p>
<p>If it is set to 'No', the peer can only see the block headings on pages on which peer assessments are required.</p>
<p>On pages where there is no peer assessment, they will not be able to see anything.</p>
<p>If an account holder has the role of 'Peer and manager', they can always see the entire portfolio, no matter this setting here.</p>
