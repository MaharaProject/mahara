<h3>Anti-spam</h3>

<p>There are three levels of anti-spam protection available for publicly
visible forms, such as the Contact Us and Registration forms. A form
submission is never silently rejected. Rather, an error message is displayed
asking the user to try again if the submission is classified as spam.</p>

<p><b>None: </b>No anti-spam checks will be performed on form submissions.</p>

<p><b>Simple: </b>Some basic checks are performed. Form submissions with email
addresses that are not well-formed, or that have an excessive number of URLs,
are rejected.</p>

<p><b>Advanced: </b>(Requires an internet connection). Performs additional
checks to determine whether email addresses are real, or contained URLs are
blacklisted.</p>
