<h3>Parent authority</h3>
<p>If you set a parent authority, users will be able to log in using that
authentication method as well as single sign-on via LTI.</p>
<p>For example, you could set up SAML authentication in your institution
and have that be the parent of LTI. That means that users will be able
to log in using the SSO button on the Mahara homepage as well as via LTI SSO from an external application.</p>
<p>You do not have to set a parent authority. If you do not, users will
only be able to access Mahara via LTI.</p>
