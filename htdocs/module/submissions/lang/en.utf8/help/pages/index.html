<h1>Submissions within a group</h1>
<p>The table contains the portfolios that you submitted for assessment to a group or for which you are the assessor.</p>
<p>Use the "Search" field to search for anything relating to the submission, e.g. the name of the portfolio author, the title of the portfolio, or the name of the assessor.</p>
<p>Use the "Quick filters" to narrow down the portfolios shown in the table. These quick filters are "sticky", i.e. they stay set until you change them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Group in which you made the submission or for which you want to view the submissions you are assigned to</li>
  <li>Your role in the submission process, i.e. either the assessor or the portfolio author</li>
  <li>Tasks associated with submissions</li>
  <li>Assessor assigned to the submissions</li>
  <li>Feedback placed</li>
  <li>Result of the assessment</li>
  <li>Status of the submitted portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p>You can decide which columns to display in the table by using the "Configure columns" button.</p>
<p>Sort the table according to the column header that you prefer. Each column can be sorted in ascending and descending order.</p>
